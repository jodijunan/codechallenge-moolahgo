## Steps to run

1. Import the database (mg_moohlago.sql) to server database.
2. The REST API will be running on the http://localhost/api/user/process.php?referralcode=ASD123
3. If the REST API is not running, try to include the folder http://localhost/moolahgo/api/user/process.php?referralcode=ASD123

## After thought

This is the first time I tried to create REST API using PHP. Due to lack of techical knowledge and time, I am unable to deliver a REST API to post the query into database.
